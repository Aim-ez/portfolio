# Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website, built with **React** and styled using **Tailwind CSS**. This site showcases my projects, skills, and background as a developer.

> 💡 If you're seeing a blank screen with just "portfolio", it's because this project is a frontend React app and needs to be built and served properly to run.
